# E-Commerce website using React JS 

In this project, I leveraged the power of ReactJS and employed various libraries to enhance the user experience. 🌐 JSON Server played a pivotal role in simulating the backend, allowing me to create APIs that seamlessly interacted with the frontend. 

🔄 Key libraries such as React Router Dom, Bootstrap, React Bootstrap, and Axios were instrumental in shaping the project's architecture. 

📚 Let me break it down for you:
React Router Dom: Streamlined navigation for a seamless user journey.
Bootstrap & React Bootstrap: Ensured a clean and responsive design for a polished look.
Axios: Facilitated smooth communication between the frontend and simulated backend.
But it doesn't stop there! 🎉 To add a touch of celebration, I incorporated Confetti for those moments of joy and utilized SweetAlert to ensure that alerts not only convey information but also do so with style.
